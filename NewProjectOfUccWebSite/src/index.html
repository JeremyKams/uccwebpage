          the following images are children who lost their parents during the civil war,ebola out break,mund slide,corona out break and other natural couses in SierraLeone. This childre has been suffering from agony of being an Orphan in which the UCC scout foundation stood for to make them a better persons in society. With your help, we can achieve that goal. During our annual visit in SierraLeone, we also go to the hard-to-reac places in the country(slums) and render the less privilege with food stuff and clothing"
